An excerpt of the Elevence development repository
=================================================

The code in the sibling directories provides an excerpt of the Elevence
development repository and is intended to serve as a template for other
companies that want to start using Haskell in production.

To build and test all applications we use
[`stack`](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README.html) as follows.
```
stack test
```

Happy coding,
the Elevence Digital Finance AG development team.
