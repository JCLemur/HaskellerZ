To make profiled builds when using libraries, those libraries have to
be built with profiling enabled:
  cabal install --enable-library-profiling

Or add this to ~/.cabal/config to make it the default:
  library-profiling: True

http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/profiling-and-optimization.html

Briefly:
  ghc -prof -fprof-auto -rtsopts --make main.hs
