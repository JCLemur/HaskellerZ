HaskellerZ Scratchpad
=====================

For now, we just use a chronological directory structure to store the notes,
slides, code from our HaskellerZ meetups. Once we have some more material, we
can start to organize it more thoroughly; e.g., using symlinks to group talks
and other things into separate directories.

Everyone can have commit rights. Just send me a message from your github
account.

Cheers, Simon.
