Slides from past meetups

TODO: Add more slides.

  Simon Meier - An Introduction to GHC's Haskell execution model 
  ([slides](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/blob/master/meetups/20130321-Intro_GHC_RTS/finished_talk/slides.html), 
   [handout](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/blob/master/meetups/20130321-Intro_GHC_RTS/finished_talk/handout.html))

HaskellerZ Scratchpad
=====================

For now, we just use a chronological directory structure to store the notes,
slides, code from our HaskellerZ meetups. Once we have some more material, we
can start to organize it more thoroughly; e.g., using symlinks to group talks
and other things into separate directories.

Everyone can have commit rights. Just send me a message from your github
account.

Cheers, Simon.
